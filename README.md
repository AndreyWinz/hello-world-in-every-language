A fun collection of “Hello World” programs written in as many programming languages as possible.

# 🌍 Hello World in Every Language

A gloriously unnecessary repository containing **Hello World** programs written in as many programming languages as possible.

Why?  
Because it's funny. Because it's classic. Because it's tradition.  
And because programmers can't resist adding one more language.

## 🚀 How it works

Each file in this repo prints:

Hello, World!

(or the closest equivalent in that language)

File names follow this format:

hello.(extension)

Examples:

- `hello.py`
- `hello.js`
- `hello.cpp`
- `hello.r`
- `hello.bf`
- `hello.whatever`

## 🤝 Contributing

Please add a new language!  
Rules:

1. File must print “Hello, World!”
2. Keep it small.
3. Add it in the right folder (or create a new folder for new languages).
4. Add your language to the list above.
5. If you want, add the same language's hello world but in a different file format (still has to be the language's file format!!!) like "hello.rb" and "hello.ruby" are welcome to be two different files!

PRs welcome from beginners, experts, and interdimensional beings.
